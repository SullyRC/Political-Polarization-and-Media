# Political-Polarization-and-Media
This project is an analysis of political polarization vs social media and traditional media usage. This project was part of DTSC 2302 and required the use of a linear model as part of the projects deliverables.
Data was from CCES-2020. The raw CSV file is too large for GitHub apparently so to find this data go to this link: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910/DVN/E9N6PH.
I highly encourage reading the paper to get an understanding of our findings as well as more explanation for our methodology and background. The coding of this project was done entirely by myself.
